var myString: string;
// I can assign myString like this:
myString = "Bee stinger";
// Why is there a problem with this? What can I do to fix this?
myString = "9";
//9 needed quotes to make it a string since the variable is a string

function sayHello(name: string){
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
 }
 // This is working great:
 console.log(sayHello("Kermit"));
 // Why isn't this working? I want it to return "Hello, 9!"
 console.log(sayHello('9'));
//Each consolelog is passing a function (sayhello), which is returning Hello 
    //(name). Name is a string variable, so like above the inputs need "".
    //And like above, the 9 didnt have them so i had to fix that again.

function fullName(firstName: string, lastName: string, middleName: string){
   let fullName = `${firstName} ${middleName} ${lastName}`;
   return fullName;
}
// This works:
console.log(fullName("Mary", "Moore", "Tyler"));
// What do I do if someone doesn't have a middle name?
console.log(fullName("Jimbo", "Jones"));
//undefined is passed as the middle name since there is not one provided

    lastName: "Yang",
    belts: 2
 }
 const jay = {
    firstName: "Jay",
    lastName: "Patel",
    belts: 4
 }
 // This seems to work fine:
 console.log(graduate(christine));
 // This one has problems:
 console.log(graduate(jay));
 //Thi one did not work becaue there wa an s left out of belt and so it wasnt refering to anything
